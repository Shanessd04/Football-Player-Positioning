# ⚽ Data-Driven Positioning System for Optimizing Player Position in Football Matches

This project presents a machine learning pipeline for analyzing and optimizing player positions in football (soccer) matches using player tracking data. It clusters spatiotemporal movement patterns to identify tactical zones, player roles, and provide insights into strategic positioning.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Analyze player tracking data from football matches
- Cluster player movements to define optimal playing zones
- Visualize heatmaps and position distributions
- Support coaches and analysts with data-backed positioning insights
